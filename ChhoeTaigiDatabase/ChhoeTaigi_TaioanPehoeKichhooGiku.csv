When it is used to indicate a present condition or state, as in the examples given in Volume II at the end of Lesson 22 of the grammar, the best from seems to be to have this particle ""[le]"", regardless of what its original tone might be, follow the tone of the verb, which preceds it, accroding to the rule: The 1st tone is followed by the 1st; the 2nd, 3rd and 4th tones are followed by the 3rd; the 5th, 7th and 8th tones are followed by the 7th tone, when ""le"" occurs at the end of phrases, clauses or sentences.","","","","Thang-á-mn̂g koaiⁿ--leh./Sèng-tn̂g ê mn̂g só--leh./I chit-má tó--leh./I hiān-chāi chē--leh./I chit-má ū tī--leh.","The windows are closed.\The door of the church is closed.\He is now lying down.\He is now sitting town.\He is at home now.","窗戶都關著/聖堂的門鎖著/他現在臥著/他現在坐著/他現在在家","","441"

"3214","le","","le","","le","","le","","","","This same particle ""[le]"" is used as an enclitic to indicate a mild command. In this case it goes into the 3rd tone.

Our teachers here at the Taichung Language School do  not agree with this. They say, although natives may use ""[le]"", as explained above it is not good form.
